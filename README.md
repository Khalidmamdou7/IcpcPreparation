# Contribution
To add notes, open a pull request and mention all of us; to keep all of us updated :).

If you want to add a new problem/solution, don't forget to add the following beside the source code as a comment: 
- Problem description source
- Key-learnings from the problem. What have you learnt from it? (recommended, as it would save time)

Use the readme inside each topic to add general notes and common mistakes which could be revised regularly.
