# IcpcPreparation
A repo containing notes during our preparation for the ACM ICPC contests. The language we are using is c++. 

We are opened to any:
- code reviews ‚úèÔ∏è
- Tips, tricks and advice to improve our coding skills üí°
- Just sharing a link that might help, is highly appreciated üîó

# General Useful Resources
- [Competitve programming book questions by topics](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org). 
  - You need to make account first in order for the problems to show up.
- [Mostafa Saad Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=1721765096).
  - Contains questions for each topics.
  - Read the checklist tab

# General Notes and Checklists
- [ ] For multiple input test cases, use two identical test cases consecutively. Both must output the same result. This is to check whether you have forgotten to initialize some variables, which will be easily identified if the 1st instance produce correct output but the 2nd one does not.
- [ ] Generate large random test cases. See if your code terminates on time and still give reasonably ok output (correctness is hard to verify here ‚Äì this test is only to verify that your code runs within time limit and without <b>runtime errors<b>)
  
# Navigate Repo
This readme will contains the general useful resources and general notes. 

- allSolutions folder
  - will contains all of our solutions for different problems from different online judges.
- topics folder
  - Each topic will have its own folder containing notes about it, hard problems, common mistakes and etc.
- teamContests folder
  - we will try to solve some contests as a team and we will include our solutions for these contests there. In addition, we will include notes about our strategy and how to develop it next time.
  
# Contribution
To add notes, open a pull request and mention all of us; to keep all of us updated :).

If you want to add a new problem/solution, don't forget to add the following beside the source code as a comment: 
- Problem description source
- Key-learnings from the problem. What have you learnt from it? (recommended, as it would save time)

Use the readme inside each topic to add general notes and common mistakes which could be revised regularly.
