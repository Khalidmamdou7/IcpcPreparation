# IcpcPreparation
A repo containing notes during our preparation for the ACM ICPC contests. Each topic has a folder containing notes about it (hard problems, hints, common mistakes, etc ..). 
# Contribution
To add notes, open a pull request and mention all of us; to keep all of us updated :).
If you want to add a new problem/solution, don't forget to add the following inside your code as a comment: 
- Problem description source
- Key-learnings from the problem. What have you learnt from it? (recommended, as it would save time)
- source code

Use the readme inside each topic to add general notes and common mistakes which could be revised regularly.
